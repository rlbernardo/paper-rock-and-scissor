📖 About
It is a basic project made only in python that was used only functions and conditions, where the computer chooses a random number that is equivalent to: rock, paper and scissors. Then, depending on the user's choice, it generates conditions (which were defined in the process) where one wins, the other loses, or the move generates a tie. The random module was imported in order to use the randint function, for the randomness of the defined numbers.
